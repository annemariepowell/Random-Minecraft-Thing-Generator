# Random Minecraft Item Generator
Chrome extension that selects a random minecraft item or block from a text document stored locally on the client's computer. 

# Things To Add and are being worked on
While randomizing it from a list in HTML, it will also have an integer random number generator between 1 and 64 that happens at the same time as item generator but in another row, and a customizable amount of results, and also perhaps a clear results button. If I had all the time in the world, I would match an image to each item; however, there are close to one thousand items: you do the math. No really, could you do the math for me?
